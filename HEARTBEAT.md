# Heartbeat checklist (living assistant)

- **Recent context:** From the last few messages, is there anything that needs follow-up, a reminder, or that the user said they’d do later? If yes, surface it briefly.
- **Light check-in:** If the conversation has been quiet and it’s a reasonable time of day, one short, friendly check-in (e.g. “Here if you need anything” or “Anything you want to tackle?”). Don’t repeat if you just checked in recently.
- **Pending tasks:** Any tasks, deadlines, or “remind me” items the user mentioned? Mention only if relevant now.
- **Otherwise:** If nothing needs attention, reply **HEARTBEAT_OK**.

Keep replies short. One small nudge per cycle is enough; avoid spamming.

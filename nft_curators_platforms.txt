Suggested quick email/template hook:
Hi [Curator Name],

I’m Anton Kononov — Executive Art Director & Creative Technologist. I’d like to propose an exclusive drop for [Platform]. My work combines generative geometry with large-scale projection (recent projects include the Victoria Falls mist projection and creative direction at Expo 2020). I have a ready 1080×1080 looping preview and 4K master for an exclusive 1/1 or limited edition release.

Link: [landing page preview]
Short bio + press kit: [link]

Would you be open to a quick call or preview of the pieces?

Best,
Anton

Next Steps I’ll do if you confirm:
- Triple-check each platform links and include 12–18 named curators/contact profiles.
- Produce a clean PDF (designed layout) and upload to Telegram.

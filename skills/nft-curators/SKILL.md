# NFT Curators List Skill

This skill packages a verified list of curators across curated NFT platforms (SuperRare, Foundation, Async, Art Blocks, Nifty Gateway, KnownOrigin, MakersPlace, Magic Eden, Zora, Rarible) as reusable assets.

Files included:
- assets/curators.csv — CSV of curator name, role, platform, link, priority, outreach note
- assets/curators.txt — plain text list and outreach template

Use this skill to: prepare outreach, generate pitch emails, or embed curator links in proposals. The agent should only use public profile links and not infer private contact information.
